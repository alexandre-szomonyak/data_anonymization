# data_anonymization

In script.py there are two pre-trained models (spacy and flair) that are performing data anonymization with NER on a given dataset. The anonymized versions of the text from the benchmark file can be retrieved in a new csv file that is created at the end of the script.

The benchmark.py file compares the two pre-trained models on both their performance and their accuracy when given the same dataset.
